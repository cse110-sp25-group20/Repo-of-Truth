# Team20- vibeCoders Charter 

## 1. Team Purpose and Objectives

### Purpose: 
Our team is building a Pokémon Card Collecting App that replicates the experience of a physical card binder while offering powerful digital tools for organizing, managing, and showcasing collections.

### Objectives:
- Develop core features such as card browsing, collection tracking, and wishlist management.
- Support a variety of user types (resellers, collectors, casuals, and beginners).
- Create an optimized UI for both desktop and mobile use.
- Mitigate risks related to API use, data input, and responsive design.
- Ensure clean, well-documented code through CI/CD, testing, and peer reviews.

## 2. Common Values and Standards
Our team commits to the following shared values:
- **Respect:** All voices matter and will be heard. Members should respect each other's ideas and communicate in a respectful manner. 
- **Accountability:** Each member should be accountable and attend regular meetings. Members should be responsible for their assigned issues and adhere to timelines. Members should reply regularly to slack discussions and be active.
- **Transparency:** We share updates and blockers openly to track progress.
- **Quality:** We prioritize clean code, meaningful documentation, automations, and functional features.
- **Growth:** We support one another in learning and improving throughout the project. If someone is blocked in an issue, we collaborate on the issue.

## 3. Roles, Responsibilities, and Accountability
Our team operates collaboratively without fixed roles. Instead, responsibilities are shared and dynamically assigned based on each member’s availability, interest, and strengths.
- Tasks will be distributed through team discussion and GitHub Issues.
- Members are encouraged to take initiative and help where needed, especially if someone is blocked/stuck in standup meetings.
- Responsibilities such as UI development, API integration, testing, and documentation will rotate as necessary to ensure shared learning and equal contribution.
- Major decisions will be made as a group, and members must communicate progress regularly.
We believe this flexible structure allows us to adapt to changes in members' availability while promoting skill development and shared ownership of the project.

## 4. Conflict Resolution Strategy
- Step 1: Attempt to resolve the issue one-on-one through respectful dialogue.
- Step 2: If unresolved, raise the issue in a team meeting for group discussion.
- Step 3: If further escalation is needed, consult the instructor or TA for guidance.
- Conflicts will be documented if they impact deliverables.

## 5. Potential Issues
The current issues we are facing and trying to mediate are the following
- **Uneven Workload:** Some team members may unintentionally take on more work than others. --> We are hoping to fix that by regularly using GitHub projects and tracking assigned issues
- **Communication Gaps:** Missed messages or unclear updates may cause delays or misunderstandings. --> We are trying to fix this issue, however, we are still facing some obstacles.
- **Inconsistent Availability:** Schedules may shift due to exams, personal obligations, or illness. --> We understand life circumstances are different, so we try to keep meetings short, document meetings, document design decisions, work individually or in pairs to have more flexibility with scheduling, and give lighter work if the member is not available for the sprint.

## 6. Addressing Rule Violations
If a team member does not follow agreed-upon rules (e.g., missing meetings, not completing assigned tasks, or lack of communication), we will follow this process:
1. **Friendly Reminder:** The issue will be addressed privately and respectfully to clarify expectations and offer support if needed.
2. **Group Discussion:** If the behavior continues, it will be discussed with the whole group in the next team meeting to find a solution.
3. **Redistribution of Work:** Tasks may be reassigned to prevent delays.
4. **Escalation:** Continued or severe issues will be documented and escalated to the course staff during the team leaders' meeting with the TA.

## 7. Communication Protocols
- **Primary Platform:** Slack will be used for all casual communication and quick updates. There is an announcements channel **BE SURE TO CHECK it out regularly.** 
- **Task Management:** GitHub Projects and Issues will track all assigned tasks, progress, and blockers.
- **Meeting Schedule:** We will meet three times weekly via Zoom/ or in person. Notes will be posted in the meeting notes folder.
- **Decision Making:** Group decisions will be made via discussion and consensus. The majority vote will be used
- **Availability:** Each team member will share their  availability in when2meet to plan meetings.
- **Responsiveness:** Members are expected to respond to messages within 24 hours unless prior notice is given.
- **StandUp meetings:** Make sure to bring up the issue you are stuck with in the meeting. if you experience it beforehand, let us know on slack to get appropriate support.
