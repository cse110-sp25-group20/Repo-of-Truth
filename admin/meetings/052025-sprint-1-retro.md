## Summary + Future Plans
- We came to the conclusion that communication was our number one problem
- Need a new way of communicating, some members don't receive notifications
- Felt that we dropped the ball on this sprint, need to start earlier next time. Only had 2 days
- However, we bonded over the time crunch and were impressed with what we could do under pressure
- Next sprint:
  - Finish current unfinished goals
  - Connect Pokemon API
  - Add more UI features (need to get more specifics)
