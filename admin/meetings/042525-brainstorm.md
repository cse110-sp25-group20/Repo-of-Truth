## Project ideas
- Card collector app
- Coupon collecting app
- Card design app

## Notes
- Collector game recommended
- Don't want to game-ify
- Discussed how we can start with Pokemon, then move to other cards (Baseball, Basketball, etc)
- Manually inputting card information VS. Using API
- Condition would probably have to be self reported
- Known Pokemon Card API we could use
- Implement in a way thats scalable 

### Features for Collector App
- Display cards in binder mode VS. list mode
- Sorting
- Market value access (resellers, collectors)
- Wishlist
- Possible game mode (pack opening?)

## Summary
- Most likely doing a collecter app (Pokemon focused)
- Need to remeet with missing members to get on same page
- Sending out annoucement to finalize topic choice
