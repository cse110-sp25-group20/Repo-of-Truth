## Notes
- We spent much of this meeting debating what we could accomplish within the allotted time. We feel more comfortable with Agile, but also realize that finals week is busy for everyone.
- Our biggest decision was whether or not to add a card collection page. This would bring our app much closer to completion, but require more work.
- Ultimately, we broke the problem down into pieces. While we can't do certain features that we would want, such as market value (and any of our dream features), we are going to add a collection page that can be used to view and filter all of the user's cards.
- We also discussed the need for a fallback for the API when the user has no access. We will be implementing this as a scrollable fallback list of cards that can be used when the API is down.
- Instead of assigning an issue for unit tests and documentation, we are requiring that everyone create tests and docs as they go. This will hopefully allow us to do more with our limited time.
- Like last week, we are also strongly discouraging anyone from merging PRs by themselves, and asking for at least 1 reviewer before a merge

The primary issues we decided on were:
- Collection, Binder tabs
- Create the Collection web component
- Local storage for storing collection
- Card stores page number and index for view in binder
- Refactor Binder web component to use local storage
- API fallback (scrollable subset of cards)
- E2E or integration testing
- "Remove Card" option in the modal
- CSS updates (including animation)
- "Wishlist" from modal?

These issues vary greatly in difficulty so we are going to assign story points tomorrow after assigning. After that, it's sprint time baby ðŸ’¨
