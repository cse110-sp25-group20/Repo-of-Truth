Notes:

Did a sprint warmup. Opened up the questions on google forms and talked about how happy we are for our project. This includes the clarity, autonomy, mastery, meaning, impact, and engagement.
Did a sprint retrospective activity. Discussed about what made us mad, sad, or glad during the sprint.
Talked about new methods of communication such as text chats, how to get ahead of the assignment instead of letting it get too close to the deadline. 
Banged out the project in two days. But still need more time for the project as deadline feels too short.
We plan to do two meetings a week and hopefully not have anymore communication error.

Summary
