## Notes
- We began by discussing the mental health of the team
- Mostly positive reviews but there was a sentiment of stress, especially because of finals week
- After this warmup, we assessed our adherence to Agile. Since last sprint, we relied much more on GitHub issues and the status channel to keep track of work.
- We did a good job of reviewing PRs before merging
- The CI/CD pipeline has become much more stable this sprint, which will make our workflow much smoother

## Summary + Future Plans
- We need to delete and add issues in the repo so that we can prepare for the code freeze
- We need to ensure we keep using the status channel for our standups
- Since we feel more comfortable with the Agile process, we are assigning ourselves much more work this sprint to see how far we can get on our app before the freeze.
