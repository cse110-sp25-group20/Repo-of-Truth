## Summary

We started using GitHub Issues more systematically to track task progress and responsibilities and the status channel became a regular touchpoint for updates, feedback, and blockers, increasing transparency and communication across the team.

Also started using pull request reviews and approvals to ensure higher code quality and mutual accountability. Peer feedback has become a standard part of the process.

In terms of infrastructure, our CI/CD pipeline is functional and continues to catch test coverage and build issues. While it’s not flawless, it has been reliable for most of the team’s needs.

## Notes

- Adopted GitHub Issues to manage backlog and task assignments effectively.
- Started actively updating each other in the status channel for collaboration and accountability.
- Implemented pull request reviews and approvals to enforce code quality and encourage peer learning.
- CI/CD pipeline showed inconsistent stability issues that need attention next sprint.
- Not all GitHub issues were updated consistently so we'll aim to improve clarity and completeness in task tracking.


## Future Plans
- Focus on improving pipeline reliability and documentation.
- Continue GitHub issue tracking and status updates as core communication tools.
- Maintain peer pull request reviews and approvals.
