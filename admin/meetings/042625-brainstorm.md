## Project
Card collector app

## Notes
Began by wondering how we should approach brainstorming. Opened Miro, then decided to go with FigJam since that's what the group had previously discussed.

Started brainstorming by writing down desired features. This turned into looking at options for Pok√©mon card databases and a discussion of how we could integrate it.

Considered possible difficulties with development. Then Kevin joined and added some competition for us to look at.


Then moved on to user stories. We copied the ones from the in-class assignment, then added more. Lots of jokes here.

Then narrowed focus to features and appearance. Created a layout to help organize the features by priority. Lots of discussion on what was needed, and what the dream features could be. 

Then finished with the flowchart. Made a simple diagram of how the Proof of Concept app would function. Meeting ended with discussion of gambling and pyramid scheme.

## Summary
- Decided on tools and organization of app
- Discussed key features
- Finished brainstorming in Figma
