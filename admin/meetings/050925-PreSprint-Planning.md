## Remarks
- Since process matters alot in SE, we will be having 3 weekly meetings ~ sprint planning, standup, and retrospective meetings. We will try to keep those meeting short to accomadate the fact of midterms and other life circumstances. Let us know if you are skipping a meeting beforehand. 
- We will start working on the project back log so it can help us set tasks in sprint planning meetings.
- API use needs approval, so we need to vote on API before submitting the API ADR. __Voting on slack__
- Starting next week we will be moving from mobbing collaboration to pairing/ individual depending on the issue complexity and length to save time during the production process.
- Any updates on github projects will be announced in slack too
- Don't forget to sign your names in the contract before saturday 11:59 pm 

## UI decisions concerning next week
- We initially voted on tool used for UI: whiteboard like miro or Figma
- We will vote again in the next sprint planning meeting so that everyone can be there
- Figma is chosen because of system design and it can be easily written to css

## CI/ CD pipeline notes
- A project was set up in github with 7 issues ~ 6 can be done individually but task 7 needs collaboration.
- Attendees assigned themselves to issues
- We highlighted the due date and asked if everyone can submit before so we give time for task 7 (demo, doc, and graph)
- 3 more issues left and 1 more collaborator in task 7. Will be assigned automatically by end of day
