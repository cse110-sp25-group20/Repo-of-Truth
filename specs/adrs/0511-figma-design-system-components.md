# Use Figma Design System with Reusable Components

## Context and Problem Statement
We needed consistent UI design across our application. Recreating components manually increased the risk of inconsistency and slow development.

## Considered Options

* Figma design system with reusable components
* UI creation per screen

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Figma design system**, because it ensures consistency and improves developer handoff by using pre-designed UI components. 
Moreover, designing all components initially before building pages ensures faster development, as components can be copied directly into screens without recreating them.
