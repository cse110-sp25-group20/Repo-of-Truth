# Use Figma Design System with Reusable Components

## Status
Deprecated

## Context and Problem Statement
We needed consistent UI design across our application. Recreating components manually increased the risk of inconsistency and slow development.

## Considered Options

* Figma design system with reusable components
* UI creation per screen

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Figma design system**, because it ensures consistency and improves developer handoff by using pre-designed UI components. 
Moreover, designing all components initially before building pages ensures faster development, as components can be copied directly into screens without recreating them.

## Update:
See ADR [0524-ui-consistency.md](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group20/Repo-of-Truth/tree/main/specs/adrs) for the updated decision on how UI consistency will be maintained in the absence of Figma.
