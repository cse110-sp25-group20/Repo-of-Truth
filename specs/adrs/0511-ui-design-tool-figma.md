# Use Figma for UI 
## Status
Deprecated
## Context and Problem Statement
We needed a collaborative design tool for building the user interface of our application. It was essential that this tool support real-time editing, feedback sharing, and easy access for all team members. Moreover, we need a tool that is easy to convert to css.
## Considered Options
* Figma
* Miro
## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **Figma**, because it provides the best combination of collaboration features, easily converted to css, good for UI system design, and supports high-fidelity UI design.
### Consequences
* Good, because all team members can work in parallel on the same design
* Good, because feedback and revisions are fast and trackable
* Good, because the UI mockups are high-fidelity and ready for development
* Bad, because it has complex features

### Confirmation
* Shared Figma workspace will be created and used across the design cycle
* Review in retrospectives to ensure design process is smooth and clear

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Figma

* Good, because itâ€™s web-based and requires no installation
* Good, because it supports live collaboration 
* Good, because it's widely adopted in the industry and supports high-fidelity design with component reuse
* Bad, because it has complex features

### Miro

* Good, because it offers a flexible canvas for wireframes and flowcharts
* Good, because it supports team brainstorming and quick sketching
* Bad, because it lacks tools for high-fidelity UI design
* Bad, because it requires transferring work to another tool for detailed design implementation

## Update:
See ADR [0524-ui-consistency.md](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group20/Repo-of-Truth/tree/main/specs/adrs) for the updated decision on how UI consistency will be maintained in the absence of Figma.
